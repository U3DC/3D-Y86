# 3D-Y86

## OverView

3D-Y86 is a Y86 code([what is Y86?](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/witchel/429/lectures/ISA_1.pdf)) simulator with tangible processors, light trails and halos, powered by Unity-3D.

Understanding how CPU works can be difficult, so this project is designed to help us understand with graphical lights and circuit components. Given Y86 instruction codes, it demonstrates every state of a pipelined cpu step by step, display state data clearly, and show the transferring process with light trails.

The core code(what simulates Y86 code) is provided by my partner Yixu Gao.
  
## How to Run It
